                        <h4>No matter your business, we can create great multimedia for you</h4>
                        <p>At Flipped Normal Media, LLC we work with clients in a wide variety of industries to bring compelling multimedia to whatever the project demands. Many of our services can be applied in a wide spectrum across seemingly unrelated industries.</p>
                        <h4>Architecture</h4>
                        <p>We excel at all aspects of architectural visualization and architectural animation. We can create highly detailed 3d models of all manner of architecture be it exteriors or interiors. We can create 3d models from CAD files, blueprints or even concept sketches. The 3d animations and/ or renderings can be photorealistic or stylized. We can create handouts, brochures, videos and interactive presentations to show off your building and interior designs.</p>
                        <h4>Marketing and Advertising</h4>
                        <p>We work extensively with the marketing and advertising departments of companies as well as with dedicated advertising agencies to develop multimedia content designed to best reach a target audience. Incorporating elements of photography, sound, voiceover and music, 3d renderings and 3d animation, video, text and graphic design, we can create all manner of compelling media. Whether the output is print, web or video, we have the tools and experience to create multimedia designed to sell products, services, concepts and everything in between.</p>
                        <h4>Engineering and Manufacturing</h4>
                        <p>Flipped Normal Media, LLC works regularly with engineers to develop visual solutions to aid with the understanding of technical concepts. We can develop complex 3d models and then take apart and put them back together to show non-engineers and laymen what exactly is going on. We can also create complex 3d animations of manufacturing processes. These 3d animations can then be integrated into either static videos or interactive presentations. We are great at making very technical subject matter easily accessible to the non-techies.</p>

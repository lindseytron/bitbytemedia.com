                        <h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
                        <p>Wikipedia defines Motion Graphics as: "graphics that use video and/or animation technology to create the illusion of motion or a transforming appearance. These motion graphics are usually combined with audio for use in multimedia projects."</p>
                         <p>Motion graphics are often used for advertising purposes to display a large amount of data in a short and compelling way. Often this involves a combination of photography, text, audio/ voiceover, video and 3d animation all combined to create a story, whether it is the key features of a product, the ways in which your company stands out, or why someone should buy your product. At Flipped Normal Media , we can create exciting motion graphics presentations to sell your project.</p>

                        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
                        <p>Most people are familiar with graphic design whether they know the term or not. Graphic design includes everything from product packaging to logos, brochures to billboards. We can create full company branding including all of those and more. We can also create 3d elements to be rendered out and included as part of any design. This is where we really stand out from most advertising agencies.</p>

                        <h2>Presentations</h2>
                        <p>We can develop exciting interactive Flash-based presentations that can be put on the web, or played off of CD to sell your project. The ability to have non-linear presentations to sell your services is a great marketing tool that gets the consumer really engaged in what you are saying as opposed to a boring linear Powerpoint Presentation that puts the user to sleep. Add in audio and voiceover and you have a stand-alone sales pitch that doesn't require your sales staff to travel. Let us develop your presentation today.</p>

                        <h2>Compositing</h2>
                        <p>Compositing is combining two or more separate images into one, whether it is a photograph or video. We can create new images by compositing elements together. Need a photo of someone placed in an entirely different environment? That's compositing. We can also composite 3d elements into photographs such as adding a rendering of the car your company sells into a photograph of a bucolic country road. Compositing is a good way to get the kind of look you require without having to go on expensive photo shoots.</p>

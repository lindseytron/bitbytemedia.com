                        <p>Flipped Normal Media excels at all the intricate and varied aspects of 3d visualization and 3d animation. This is where we are really able to shine. There are many uses for 3d visualization beyond just "cartoons". The ability to build a 3d model and then render it from any camera angle under any lighting condition at any resolution is an extremely powerful tool for all aspects of media. Existing objects are just the tip of the iceberg. 3d models can be produced for anything you can imagine. Wish to get funding for a product before building an expensive prototype? A 3d model that can be rendered in a photorealistic manner will accomplish the same thing in much less time and for much less cost. The possibilities and uses are truly limitless.</p>

                        <h2>3D Modeling</h2>
                        <p>3d modeling is the foundation that all aspects of visualization is built upon. Models are created using all manner of reference from CAD drawings, photographs, actual objects, or even concept sketches. The more reference we have, the faster it is to model an object (and the more accurate it will be). Once the model is created then it gets texture mapped and shaded. Basically this defines what the model looks like. At the minimum, it's color and shininess. After that it is ready to be rendered.</p>

                        <h2>3D Rendering</h2>
                        <p>After the 3d model or 3d models are built and textured the scene is lit. Basically a 3d scene is like a movie set. The 3d models are the actors, props and sets. The textures are wardrobe and set decoration. 3d Lights are then added to the scene. They can be physically accurate lights or stylized to elicit a specific mood. After the 3d lights are set up, a virtual 3d camera is added. The 3d camera behaves just as a physical camera would including different lenses. The image is then ready to be rendered. Basically this is the process where the computer calculates all the lighting and shaders and generates the final image. The final output can be photographically accurate (photorealistic) or very stylized and painterly. It just depends on what look is required.</p>

                        <h2>3D Animation</h2>
                        <p>3d animation really opens up possibilities. Need to show the process of assembly? 3d animation is a good way to show the steps required. 3d animation can occur at any scale from the movement of electrons to the movements of galaxies. Animating a walkthrough of a building is a good way to sell your designs to your client without having to invest in actual materials. 3d lighting and textures can be animated as well as 3d models and cameras. You can show the progression of day to night to show what your building will look like throughout an entire day. Basically if you can describe it, it can be animated. 3d animation can be a very powerful and cost effective tool.</p>
